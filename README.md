# CS 2401 week 1 lab
 
For this week's lab, we should all be getting familiar with how to submit our lab assignments using GitHub. 

## Assignment
### Task 1
Update this README file by deleteing all of the text above the line below that says "Delete the text before this (and this line too)" then use markdown to:
* Add a 1st level header with your name before the question list
* Add a 2nd level header with the name of the course
* Answer the questions below by first making the question text bold, then adding your answer in non-bold text. 

You can us the github markdown [formatting instructions](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) from thier website. 

Note that this repo (like all of your github classroom assignments) is private and can only be read by the intructional staff). If you would prefer to email your responses make this document say only "I have emailed the assignment" and email your responses to the instructor and TA. 

### Task 2
Sign up for the zyBook textbook (instructions are in the syllabus). 

### Task 3
Send a private message (in chat) to your instructor using MS Teams to say hello. (approrpiate GIFs and/or emoji are welcome) as well as your github username and UTEP ID.

### Task 4
Modify the given java program `Week1.java` (found in the `src` folder) creates a string `s` which will be set to your name, then prints each character in the string on its own line.

Example: name is `Dan DeBlasio` so the output will be 
```
